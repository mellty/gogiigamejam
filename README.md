## June the Cats Rescue

**Game Jam Theme:** Isolation.

**Our Idea**: Help June the Cat rescue the furry friends trapped in the cave.

## Rules

1. To help June rescue the furry friends, you need to select the right puzzle piece from the 8 that will appear on the screen. When you select the correct piece, June will move to the next missing puzzle piece and be one step closer to rescuing the furry friends. It’s kind of tricky and the time moves quickly!
2. June’s rescue missions get more complicated as the game progresses, but we know you can help June with these missions!

Good luck!
